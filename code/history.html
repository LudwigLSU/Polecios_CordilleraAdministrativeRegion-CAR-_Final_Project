        <h1>History of Cordillera Administrative Region</h1>
    </div>

    <div class="history">
        <div class="par1"><p><strong>The Cordillera Administrative Region</strong>, often referred to as CAR, is located in the northern part of Luzon. It is known for its majestic mountain ranges, rich culture, and strong sense of identity among its people. The region is home to several indigenous groups collectively known as the Cordillerans or Igorots, who have preserved their traditions, languages, and customs for centuries. These mountain communities are among the few in the Philippines that maintained independence and resisted foreign rule for most of history.</p><br></div>
        <div class="img1"><br><img src="../content/car.png"><br></div>
        <div class="par2"><br><p><strong>During the Spanish colonization of the Philippines</strong>, the Cordillera highlands were never fully conquered. The Spanish government made numerous attempts to control the area, largely because of its gold resources, but the mountainous terrain and the courage of the Igorot warriors prevented their success. This isolation allowed the Cordilleran people to retain their way of life, beliefs, and social structures despite the spread of Spanish influence across the rest of the country.</p><br></div>
        <div class="par3"><br><p><strong>When the Americans came to the Philippines in the early 1900s</strong>, they established the Mountain Province in 1908 as part of their efforts to organize the northern territories. They introduced public education, new infrastructure, and limited governance reforms, but much of the region's traditional lifestyle remained intact. Over time, the single Mountain Province was divided into several provinces, including Benguet, Ifugao, Kalinga, Apayao, Abra, and what is now the present-day Mountain Province. Each province developed its own local government while continuing to share a common cultural heritage.</p><br></div>
        <div class="par4"><br><p><strong>After World War II</strong>, movements for greater self-determination began to grow. Many Cordillerans sought recognition of their ancestral lands and protection of their cultural identity. During the 1970s and 1980s, regional organizations and advocacy groups worked to promote autonomy, arguing that the people of the Cordillera deserved to govern themselves in accordance with their traditions and values. This struggle for autonomy led to increased awareness of Cordilleran rights and unity among the provinces.</p><br></div>
        <div class="par5"><br><p><strong>On July 15, 1987</strong>, President Corazon C. Aquino signed Executive Order No. 220, officially creating the Cordillera Administrative Region. This historic step brought together the provinces of Abra, Apayao, Benguet, Ifugao, Kalinga, and Mountain Province, along with Baguio City, into one administrative unit. The purpose of the region's creation was to accelerate development, preserve the Cordilleran culture, and lay the foundation for eventual regional autonomy within the Republic of the Philippines.</p><br></div>

        <div class="par6"><br><p>Today, the Cordillera Administrative Region continues to embody resilience and cultural pride. Its people maintain a deep respect for their environment and traditions while embracing modern progress. The region is celebrated for its breathtaking natural wonders such as the Banaue Rice Terraces, Mount Pulag, and Sagada's caves and hanging coffins. More importantly, it stands as a living testament to the strength, unity, and enduring spirit of the Cordilleran people, who have successfully preserved their heritage through centuries of change.</p></div>
